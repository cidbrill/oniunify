### Where could the concepts discussed in class be seen in your website?

Many ideas we've been taught have been put into practice throughout this page. Right from the start on the authentication page, you can see the use of HTML forms and CSS transitions. Another thing is the use of Flexboxes, which made alignments and adjustments easier, especially on the Home Page of the site. We also used a lot of JavaScript codes for dynamic updates and event handling. But most importantly, we integrated an API into the site, which, to be honest, was intimidating at first but became overall easy once you got the hang of it.

### What was your inspiration for the design of the website?

Honestly, we stuck quite closely to Twitter's original design because deviating too far might complicate the ideation process. However, the driving force behind this code is rooted in the concept of onions, influencing both the color palette and the site's name, "Oniunify," a blend of the words Onion and Unify. Our ideation unfolded in a unique manner; we employed the wheel of names and incorporated all conceivable colors on the color wheel. The color selected as the best in three attempts became our final palette, ultimately settling on Red Purple. Drawing inspiration from this palette, we brainstormed and arrived at the idea of onions as the perfect representation.

### What was your approach in creating the content of the website?

Consistently, we emphasized the mantra "Utilize divs" throughout our discussions. Given that the design heavily leans on flexboxes, we are convinced that employing divs will significantly streamline adjustments and alignments. In the initial stages, our approach involved envisioning each visible element and categorizing them into divs. This segmentation proved invaluable as it helped us discern how to effectively group and structure the various elements in our design.

### How is your website creative?

We adjusted the layout and the other content that we deem can become better and look more pleasing according to how we envision it. Making these adjustments and adding the team's twist according to the liking of the team is what made the website creative having our own taste meddled in with what already works/looks astonishing.

### What did you use to deploy your website?

Initially, we opted for GitHub Pages as our deployment platform, following the guidance provided by our instructor, who had previously instructed us on deploying personal websites using this method. However, we encountered a limitation when our instructor informed us that GitHub Pages cannot effectively deploy express.js applications. In response to this, he instructed us on using Netlify for our deployments, as it aligns with the requirements and capabilities of our express.js application.

### How did you divide the tasks between the team, and what is the responsibility of each one?

Obviously, the team has been divided into two distinct groups: the Front-end and the Back-end. Taking charge of the Front-end development are three members from our group - Jyrel, Mariel, and Vincent. They are entrusted with crafting the user interface and overall visual experience. In parallel, Bernard has been assigned the pivotal role of handling the Back-end responsibilities, specifically focusing on the seamless integration of the API into the site. Additionally, Cid will be spearheading the general production aspects of the website, ensuring a cohesive and well-executed final product. This division of roles ensures a focused and collaborative effort, with each team member contributing their expertise to different facets of the project.

### How did you prevent your changes in code from conflicting with each other?

Recognizing the potential challenges, the team proactively addressed them by designating only one member to push changes to the repository. Each team member independently works on their assigned tasks, and upon reaching specific milestones, they submit their code to the designated contributor. This individual thoroughly examines the compatibility of the submitted code with the main codebase before permitting it to be pushed. This meticulous process has proven effective in minimizing merge conflicts to a significant extent. By implementing this strategy, the team has fostered a development environment where members can adapt and contribute to the site's progress with greater ease.

### How you could improve your website in the future?

We could improve our website in the future by prioritizing a refined aesthetic that exudes professionalism and sophistication. This may involve adopting upcoming design trends and techniques, such as minimalist layouts, elegant typography, and subtle animations, to create a visually captivating experience for our visitors. In addition, we could explore incorporating innovative user interface features such as personalized recommendations and seamless navigation, fostering deeper engagement and satisfaction among our audience. By continuously researching and implementing the latest advancements in technology and design strategies, we can keep our website dynamic, contemporary, and aligned with our brand's ethos of delivering exceptional quality.
